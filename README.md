## Welcome to the Launch Presales Website
### What is presales?
The role of presales is an odd position as you can ask people in two different companies what it is, or what someone in presales does but can get two different answers. This may be because they offer different positions, or that they don't have the right idea to what presales is. So in the following pages you can learn what actual presales interns and new hires think the position is all about.







## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Matthieu98/Launchtest/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Matthieu98/Launchtest/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
